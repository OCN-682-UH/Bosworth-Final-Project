## Repository contents
* MBIO 612: Final Project: Interactive grain size distribution map
> * Packages used: tidyverse, here, leaflet, tidyr

> * Dataset Grainsize - grainsize calculations and water quality parameters, sampled suring wet and dry seasons. 

#### The Goal
I wanted to focus on 2 sampling dates that occurred in the dry and wet season, 9/14/23 and 12/20/23, my goal is to create map that will display grain size % and WQ data in an pop-up style window. The data show has been collected from the Heʻeia Fishpond. Future works will integrate eDNA data (species presence and absebce) as well as grain size distribution data from participating loko iʻa systems.
